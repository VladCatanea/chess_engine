# Chess Engine built using python 

This is an example of a chess engine that can calculate 3 moves in advance built using python and advice from (Chess Programming Wiki)[https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page]

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. (Python 3)[https://www.python.org/]
2. (Pygame 2.1+)[https://www.pygame.org/]
3. (Numpy 1.21+)[https://numpy.org/]

### Run 

Run **chess.py** from terminal 

Drag and drop to move chess pieces, **u** key undos the last move (a bit buggy because the computer immediately redos its move), and up and down arrow keys scroll through the move log on the right side of the board.
